        title: '"Through the Sunken Glades"',
        description: 'Inspired by games like <em class="logo">Ori and the Blind Forest</em> and <em class="logo">Seasons After Fall</em>.  I wanted to bring to life all of the woodland creatures, plants, and little spirits, so I used exotic winds and percussion from both <a class="content--link" href="http://embertone.com/" target="_blank" title="Embertone">Embertone</a> and <a class="content--link" href="https://soundiron.com/" target="_blank" title="Soundiron">Soundiron</a> to paint the proper picture.  Strings, dulcimer, harp, and various synths/sound design as well.'

        title: '"The Ruined City of Quil"',
        description: 'The ruins of an ancient temple.  Endless corridors, colossal antichambers, and history long lost.  This piece accompanies <em class="logo">Son of Nor\'s</em> protagonist as they journey through the ruined temple of Taro, in the ancient city of Quil.  This was created mostly with strings from LA Scoring Strings, and live xiao.  I felt the long reverbs and lonely flute estbalished the feeling of being alone in such a long forgotten place quite perfectly.'

        title: '"Mable: The Journey"',
        description: 'As an exercise to learn dynamic music layering in Wwise, I created this piece to accompany gameplay in <em class="logo">Mable: The Journey by Triple Vision Games</em>.  Its upbeat and exciting style was inspired by a fusion of Madeon and Disasterpeace.  In the end, I think it does a great job of adding to the fantasy atmosphere in a fast-paced retro world.'

        title: '"Breeze"',
        description: 'Relaxing wind across Scottish cliffside plateaus, and the faint sound of chimes in the distance.  <em class="logo">Breeze</em> accompanies the player in their quest to herd sheep with a trusting (and unintentionally goofy) border collie in <em class="logo">Bleat!</em>.  Live guitar, <a class="content--link" href="https://soniccharge.com/synplant" target="_blank" title="Synplant">Synplant</a>, upright bass, instruments from the <a class="content--link" href="http://www.fbpsound.com/The-Toyshop-Sample-Library" target="_blank" title="Toyshop Sample Library">Toyshop Library</a>, and various synths.'

        title: '"Giraffe Beats"',
        description: 'Created for Nico Prinz\'s <em class="logo">Oh My Giraffe</em>, an endless runner in Africa\'s savanna.  Because of the simple and colorful art style, I decided that a very MIDI/dry sampled approached would work best for the music.  I ended up using quite a bit of African percussion, some sampled and some live, as well as a dry Pan flute for the melody.'

        title: '"Winter"',
        description: 'Created as a music redesign for <em class="logo">Northguard\'s</em> winter environment.  I wanted to create a sense of cold and loneliness, and I think the solemn progression along with the deep reverbs and bass does this quite well.  The flutes, especially the Irish penny-whistle, and the fluttering strings really lend themselves well to the frigid atmosphere and the search for warmth.'
