    'description' : 'After some time away from my instruments, I created <em>Through the Sunken Glades</em> to showcase some of my favorite sample-based VSTsâ€“ those of <a class="content--link" href="http://embertone.com/" target="_blank" title="Embertone">Embertone</a> &amp; <a class="content--link" href="https://soundiron.com/" target="_blank" title="Soundiron">Soundiron</a>.  This piece in particular features Embertone flutes, their mountain dulcimer, and Soundiron\'s Noah Bells.'

    'description' : 'The ruins of an ancient temple.  Endless corridors, colossal antichambers, and history long lost.  This piece accompanies <a class="content--link" href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/264000/" target="_blank" title="Son of Nor">Son of Nor\'s</a> protagonist as they journey through the ruined temple of Taro, in the ancient city of Quil.  This was created mostly with strings from LA Scoring Strings, and live xiao.  I felt the long reverbs and lonely flute estbalished the feeling of being alone in such a long forgotten place quite perfectly.'

    'description' : 'As an exercise to learn dynamic music layering in Wwise, I created this piece to accompany gameplay in <a class="content--link" href="https://triplevisiongames.itch.io/mable" target="_blank" title="Mable: The Journey">Mable: The Journey by Triple Vision Games</a>.  Its upbeat and exciting style was inspired by a fusion of Madeon and Disasterpeace.  In the end, I think it does a great job of adding to the fantasy atmosphere in a fast-paced retro world.'

    'description' : 'Relaxing wind across Scottish cliffside plateaus, and the faint sound of chimes in the distance.  <em>Breeze</em> accompanies the player in their quest to herd sheep with a trusting (and unintentionally goofy) border collie.

    'description' : 'Created for Nico Prinz\'s <a class="content--link" href="http://www.ohmygiraffe.com/" target="_blank" title="Oh My Giraffe">Oh My Giraffe</a>, an endless runner in Africa\'s savanna.  Because of <a class="content--link" href="http://www.ohmygiraffe.com/" target="_blank" title="Oh My Giraffe">Oh My Giraffe\'s</a> simple and colorful art style, I decided that a very MIDI/dry sampled approached would work best for the music.  I ended up using quite a bit of African percussion, some sampled and some live, as well as a dry Pan flute for the melody.'

    'title'       : '"Winter"',
    'description' : 'Created originally for Breadcrumbs Interactive\'s <a class="content--link" href="https://breadcrumbsinteractive.com/yaga/" target="_blank" title="Yaga">Yaga</a> as an unused demo.  This was based around Yaga\'s winter environment.  I wanted to create a sense of cold and loneliness, and I think the solemn progression along with the deep reverbs and bass does this quite well.  The flutes, especially the Irish penny-whistle, and the fluttering strings really lend themselves well to the frigid atmosphere.'
